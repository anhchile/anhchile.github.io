<h2>over view</h2>

This is my soft tailoring project at school. The concept I choose is Military. I have a huge obsession with Military style so I choose it. Military has been a trend for a long time and seems to be never old-fashioned.
This collection is designed based on Eva de Eva brand’s requirements to meet their customers’ tastes. The collection includes blazers, jackets, shirts , skirts and trousers which are following the hottest trend on the runway: Sport luxe (also known as Athleisure). The main silhouettes are loose and the embellishment are laces and metal details which remind the military vibes.
Now let’s look at which steps I have been through.

<h2>customer profile</h2>

This project is a reality one, thanks to LCDF and Eva de Eva's collaboration (Eva de Eva is a pretty famous office wear brand in Vietnam). A manager from Eva de Eva came to my class to order products which suits their target customer. I must understand which kind of customer I would design for to maximize the results in order to earn profits from selling garments. 

<h2>Concept research</h2>

I choose Military as a concept for my collection. This is my all-time favourite style that I never get bored of. I did a lot of research and take notes in my sketchbook, sketch some observation drawings, try to find out what are key details to obtain the concept's vibe. 

<h2>Trend research</h2>

			<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="/images/term 4/9.jpg" alt=""></span></div>
	 </div>

<p>As requested from Eva de Eva, this collection must be trend-driven so I did some trend research from fashion weeks and street-style to come up with one hottest trend in the runway - Sport luxe (also known as Athleisure) to combine with my concept</p>


<h2>Sourcing fabrics and trimmings</h2>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/term 4/3.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The fabric must be relevant to soft-tailoring design, the concept military and the fall winter season so I choose a medium - thick and textured fabric to make the outer wear. This kind of fabric has a suitable draping form for blazers, trousers and skirts. 

<h2>Design development</h2> 

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/term 4/6.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

This is the most exciting part in designing process. To combine two different styles, I have to investigate each type of garments: sporty clothes and military uniforms and pick up the key features of each one to consider such as laces, epaulette, stripes, metal details, metal buttons, badges, stars, loose forms, drop-shoulder, larger armhole, wide-leg pants... When designing, I try to mix up everything together and quickly sketch anything that come up to my mind. Because my customers' style is minimalism, I don't want to put too many details in one outfit. Instead of that, each outfit has a small and elegant detail to make the outfit not boring but not too outstanding.

<h3>Textiles Design</h3>

Textile designing process is an exciting part as well. Experiencing as much as possible to achieve the best result is the key thing in textile design. As I write above, my customers don't like too many details so I try to minimize the textiles that I put on my garments. However, the more minimal the design, the more delicate it should be. 

<h3>Pattern cutting & Toile making</h3>

In pattern cutting phase and toile making, garment construction and proportion are the most important thing to consider. 

<h3>Garment finishing</h3>

After making toile, the final garments are made and finished with textiles on it. 

<h2>Photoshoot styling</h2>

Photoshoot is the most important phase that can show up final result for everyone so it must be carefully planned. Choosing which photographer, model, make up artist, studio, posing, preparing for props, accessories, time planning, ... everything must be punctual and well-orgarnized.
